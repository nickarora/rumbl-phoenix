# Rumbl

Take videos (hosted elsewhere) and attach comments to them in real time.  Play them back alongside the comments of other users.  Mystery Science Theater 3000 meets Twitter.

This is an experiment in using Elixir and the Phoenix framework

To start Rumbl:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.create && mix ecto.migrate`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `npm install`
  * Build css/js with `brunch build`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phoenix.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
